# Mental Health Chatbot

This is a mental health prediction chatbot.

The Chat Bot will try to analyze a personâ€™s mental state or emotion using speech recognition. Based on the analysis it will try to provide Cognitive Behavioural Therapy(CBT) to make the person feel better. In dire situations, the Bot may also send messages to the emergency contacts provided by the person.

The Bot will only provide the person with basic help and mental health hygiene. However, for critical situations the person will have to take professional help.
